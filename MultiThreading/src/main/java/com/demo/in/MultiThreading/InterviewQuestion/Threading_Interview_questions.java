//1. What is multithreading in Java?
//2. What is the difference between process and thread?
//3. How do you create a thread in Java? Thread and Runnable both
//4. What is the difference between start() and run()?
// 5. What is the difference between Runnable and Thread?

//12. What is the difference between Callable and Runnable?
            //"Runnable is used when you don’t need a result,
            // Callable is used when you want to return a result
            // or handle exceptions from a task running in a separate thread."


//13. What is ThreadLocal in Java?
//14. What is the life cycle of a thread?**********

            /**
             New – thread created
            Runnable – eligible to run
            Running – running
            Blocked/Waiting – waiting for lock or signal
            Terminated – finished
             **/
